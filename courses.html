                                        This course integrates all soft and technical skills covered during the program through work in two major team projects. Both projects challenge participants to research and assemble new technologies. The first project is an internal project to design and build a data-driven commercial web site. The second project involves a four-week term with an industry client to build a web site or web site component. Both projects require agile systems analysis and design, project planning and management, communication of design and progress, professional presentation, and data driven website development using current best practices.
